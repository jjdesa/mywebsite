            <div class="card">
                <h3 class="sub-heading">Dependable Nursing Information Systems Context</h3>
                <p>The healthcare industry is transitioning from an inefficient, costly, manually intensive, and crises-driven model of care to a more efficient, consumer-centered, science-based model focused on health management.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Dependability Definition</h3>
                <p>Ethical obligations drive requirements for system reliability, availability, confidentiality, data integrity, responsiveness, and safety, which are collectively referred to as dependability.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Dependability Measure</h3>
                <p>Dependability is a measure of the extent to which a system can justifiably be relied on to deliver its expected services.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Attributes of Dependability</h3>
                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> Begins when an organization determines that an existing need or problem can be solved by developing or implementing a CIS or application.</li>
                    <li><strong>1. Definition of the Problem:</strong> Includes a description of how the system will be evaluated. Establishing evaluation criteria early supports the philosophy of "beginning with the end in mind". Realistic goals describe the expected results and improvements from the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Data Collection:</strong> First step in system analysis, involving collection of data reflecting the existing problem or goal. Thorough data collection may lead to refinements in the project scope agreement and added benefits.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Data Analysis:</strong> Provides data for developing an overview of the nursing problem and/or stated goal defined in the project scope agreement. Tools: Data flowchart, Grid chart, Decision table, Organizational Chart Model.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. Data Review:</strong> Focuses on resolving problems or attaining goals defined in the feasibility study based on workflow documents and functional design. Recommendations for streamlining workflow are suggested.</li>
                    <li><strong>5. Benefits Identification:</strong> Should reflect the resolution of the identified problem, formulated and stated in quantifiable terms. Proposed benefit statements become criteria for measuring the success of the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>6. System Proposal Development:</strong> Includes submission to the project‚Äôs steering committee for review and approval. Final proposal forms the basis for the next phase.</li>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Future of Nursing Informatics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nursing Informatics uses computer technology to decrease costs, increase patient-nurse interactions, and decrease redundancy of documentation.</li>
                    <li>It helps the healthcare industry stay marketable in a changing world.</li>
                    <li>It aids nurses by helping to obtain important data for patients and guiding decisions in patient care.</li>
                    <li>It is a growing field for advancement and offers potential areas for cost containment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">The Role of Informatics in Nursing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Informatics nurses are key people.</li>
                    <li>Information is power and critical for decision-making.</li>
                    <li>Nursing is a cognitive profession, with the core of nursing (ADPIE - Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation) taking place in nurses' minds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key actions:</strong> Identify potential problems. Identify changes in patient status that can occur quickly. Ensure information is readily available. Interpret, systematize, and arrange data. Formalize an appropriate plan of action. Align Nursing Best Practice with Clinical workflows & care. Improve clinical policies, protocols, processes & procedures. Standardizing Nursing Language: The use of a template can remind nurses of important information required in patient care documentation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="sub-heading">Telehealth</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Savings:</strong> Provides savings in improved access to care, allowing clients to be treated earlier and with fewer interventions. Clients receive treatment in their own community where services cost less.</li>
                    <li>Improves quality of care and continuity of care through convenient follow-up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Vary greatly, including client monitoring, diagnostic evaluations, decision support systems, storage and retrieval, research, voice recognition for dictation, and education of healthcare professionals and consumers.</li>
